.. code-block:: python

   # Internal flag checker for economic relief gateway

- Filed 2024 taxes or receive federal benefits
- Adjusted gross income (AGI):
  - **≤ $75,000** for individuals

     "filing_status": "single",
     "agi": 68000,
     "eligible": true
   }

Application & Verification
--------------------------

Most recipients will **not need to apply**. Payments are automatically processed based on IRS records or federal benefit enrollment. However, the following groups may need to verify or update their information:

- Non-filers (no 2024 tax return)
- Recently changed address or banking info
- Dependent status updates

You can check your payment status through the official IRS tracker.

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X GET https://api.federalrelief.gov/v1/payment-status \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"

   # Dev note: Check 202 response for "processing" flag

Disbursement Timeline
---------------------

The $2000 stimulus check payments are expected to roll out in **phases**:

#. **Phase 1:** Direct deposit recipients
#. **Phase 2:** Paper checks by mail
#. **Phase 3:** EIP debit cards for specific users

Estimated start: **Late Q3 2025**, subject to Congressional approval and IRS processing readiness.

.. code-block:: yaml

   payment_schedule:
     - direct_deposit: Q3_2025
     - paper_check: Q4_2025
     - debit_card: Q4_2025

Tracking Your Payment
---------------------

Users can track the status of their stimulus check through:

1. **IRS “Get My Payment” tool** (available on official site)
2. **Bank alerts or direct deposit notifications**
3. **Mail tracking** (if receiving a paper check or debit card)

Tracking tools will return payment status codes such as:

- `processing`
- `sent`
- `returned`
- `invalid banking info`

Common Issues
-------------

**Q: What if I didn’t receive the payment but believe I’m eligible?**  
A: You may need to file a Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2025 tax return.

**Q: Can I update my bank account on file?**  
A: No updates are allowed after processing begins. Changes must occur via the IRS portal before issuance.

**Q: I received a check for someone else — what should I do?**  
A: Return the check to the IRS. Do not attempt to deposit it.

Security & Fraud Warning
------------------------

Stimulus checks are issued directly from federal authorities. Be aware of common scams:

- No government agency will call or email requesting personal data for payment
- Never share your Social Security number or bank info with unverified sources
- Use only official `.gov` websites

.. code-block:: cpp

   bool isScamMessage(string message) {
       return message.find("gift card") != string::npos ||
              message.find("wire transfer") != string::npos;
   }

   // Basic detection logic for frontend validation modules
